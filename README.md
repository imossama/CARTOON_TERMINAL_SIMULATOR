#### Overview üåü
The Cartoon Terminal Simulator is a fun Python project that simulates the intelligent terminals often seen in cartoons featuring clever characters like scientists, inventors, or mad geniuses. This project uses Python and AI to create a playful environment where users can interact with a virtual terminal reminiscent of those seen in cartoons.
